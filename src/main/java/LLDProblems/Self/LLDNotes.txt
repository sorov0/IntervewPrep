✅ PART 4 — THUMB RULES TO DESIGN ANY LLD
==========================================

Use these always:

⭐ 1. Identify Key Entities (Nouns)

From requirements → extract nouns:

Example: ParkingLot, Floor, Spot, Ticket…

⭐ 2. Separate Behavior into Managers

Never overload entity classes.
Business logic lives in Managers (ParkingSpotManager, PriceManager).

⭐ 3. For all variable behavior → use Strategy Pattern

Parking strategy

Pricing strategy

Payment strategy

⭐ 4. Use SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)

Each class should have exactly one reason to change.

⭐ 5. Concurrency → handle at the object that mutates

ParkingSpot must lock itself.
ParkingLot should NOT lock the entire system.

⭐ 6. Keep Aggregates as Source of Truth

ParkingLot stores:

All floors

All active tickets

⭐ 7. Use Factory or Builder for object creation

Optional but recommended for gate creation / strategies.

⭐ 8. Prefer Composition over Inheritance

VIP-first strategy is “plugged in”, not subclassed.

⭐ 9. Expose only workflows through Facade

ParkingLot exposes:

enter()

exit()

calculateAmount()

⭐ 10. Admin must always be separate

Every system grows.
Admin creates floors/spots separately.
