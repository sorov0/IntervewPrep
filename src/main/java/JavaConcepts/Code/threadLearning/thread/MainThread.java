    // To create a thread in Java(in order to perform a task),
    // You can either extend Thread class or implement runnable interface.


    // Thread has multiple states:
    // New(Created but not started),
    // Runnable(After the start method is called, Thread becomes ready to run and waiting for CPU time),
    // Running(IN Execution state),
    // Blocked/Waiting(waiting for CPU time),
    // Terminated(finished its execution)

    // Note: Java does not have running state as such(Runnable state is itself called Running)
