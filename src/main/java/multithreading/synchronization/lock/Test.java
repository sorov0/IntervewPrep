// To overcome the issues we had in synchronization, we have lock mechanism
// Two types of lock:

// 1. Intrinsic lock: These are built into every object in java.
// We dont see them, but they are there. When we use a synchronised keyword, we are using these
// automatic locks

// 2. Explicit lock: These are more advanced locks,
